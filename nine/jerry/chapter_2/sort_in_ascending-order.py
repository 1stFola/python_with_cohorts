# 2.15 (Sort in Ascending Order) Write a script that inputs three different floating-point
# numbers from the user. Display the numbers in increasing order.
# Recall that an if statement’s suite can contain more than one statement.
# Prove that your script works by running it on all six possible orderings of the numbers.
# Does your script work with duplicate numbers?
# [This is challenging. In later chapters you’ll do this more conveniently and with many more numbers.]
